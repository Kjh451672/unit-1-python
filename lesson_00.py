#1. I created the python file in VSC
print("Kyle Heaven")
#2. Next, I printed my name into Python
fav_show = "The Owl House"
#3. This variable stores a string wiht the name of my favorite show
my_float = 3.14
my_integer = 21
#4. I created two new variables, one is a integer and one is a float
print(my_float * my_integer)
#5. I printed out the product of both previous variables
favorite_foods = ["Stew Peas","Pizza", "Fried Chicken"]
#6. I created a list with 3 of my favorite foods in one variable
drivers_permit = True
if drivers_permit == True :
    print("This person can get their liscense.")
#7. This if statement prints out the statement if the condition is true
print("What is your name?")
thier_name = input()
print("Hello " + thier_name)
#8. These 3 lines of code ask the user for thier name, and after they input it, the console says hello along with the person's name
for index in favorite_foods:
    print (index)
#9. This for-loop goes through the list i created earlier, and prints out each element one by one
impossible_loop = -1
while impossible_loop > 0:
    print("I am inevitable!")
#10. I created a while loop that will nevr run, sincethe variable in the conditional statement will never be true
